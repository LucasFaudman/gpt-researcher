# Deep Research with LangGraph

This module implements a deep research capability using LangGraph, inspired by the recursive deep research approach in GPT Researcher's `deep_research.py`.

## Overview

The Deep Research implementation uses LangGraph to create a recursive research workflow that:

1. Generates search queries based on the initial query
2. Creates a research plan with follow-up questions
3. Conducts parallel research on each search query
4. Synthesizes and reviews the research results
5. Recursively explores deeper based on follow-up questions
6. Finalizes the research with citations and context

## Architecture

The deep research system is built with the following components:

- **DeepResearchOrchestrator**: Coordinates the entire research process using LangGraph
- **DeepExplorerAgent**: Generates search queries and research plans
- **DeepResearchAgent**: Conducts basic research using GPTResearcher
- **DeepSynthesizerAgent**: Processes and synthesizes research results
- **DeepReviewerAgent**: Reviews research quality and completeness
- **DeepResearchState**: Manages the state of the research process

The LangGraph workflow is structured as follows:

```
generate_queries → generate_plan → process_queries → review_research → [recursive_research] → finalize_research
```

The recursive research step is conditionally executed based on the current depth and creates a recursive loop back to the review step.

## How It Works

1. **Query Generation**: The system generates multiple search queries based on the initial query
2. **Research Planning**: Follow-up questions are generated to guide the research
3. **Parallel Research**: Each search query is processed in parallel with a concurrency limit
4. **Research Synthesis**: Results are synthesized to extract key learnings with citations
5. **Research Review**: The quality and completeness of the research is evaluated
6. **Recursive Exploration**: If the maximum depth hasn't been reached, the system generates new queries based on follow-up questions and continues the research
7. **Finalization**: The research is finalized with a comprehensive context that includes all learnings with citations

## Usage

You can use the deep research implementation in two ways:

> **Note:** The command line examples below should be run from the parent `multi_agents` directory, not from within the `deep_research` directory.

### 1. From the command line:

```bash
# Run deep research from the multi_agents directory
python main.py --mode deep --query "Your research query" --depth 2 --breadth 4
```

### 2. Programmatically:

```python
from multi_agents.deep_research.main import run_deep_research

results = await run_deep_research(
    query="Your research query",
    depth=2,
    breadth=4,
    concurrency=2
)
```

## Configuration

You can configure the deep research process through command line arguments:

```bash
# Run deep research with all options
python main.py --mode deep --query "Your research query" --depth 2 --breadth 4 --concurrency 2 --model "gpt-4o" --verbose --pdf --docx
```

### Available Arguments
- `--query` - The research query (required)
- `--depth` - Maximum depth of recursive research (default: 2)
- `--breadth` - Number of parallel search queries at each level (default: 4)
- `--concurrency` - Maximum number of concurrent research tasks (default: 2)
- `--model` - The model to use for research (default: "gpt-4o")
- `--verbose` - Enable verbose output (default: True)
- `--pdf` - Generate PDF output (default: False)
- `--docx` - Generate DOCX output (default: False)

### Example
```bash
# Run deep research with custom parameters
python main.py --mode deep --query "Impact of climate change on agriculture" --depth 3 --breadth 5 --concurrency 3 --pdf --docx
```

## Output

The deep research process produces:

1. A comprehensive research context with citations
2. A list of key learnings from the research
3. A quality review of the research
4. A final report generated by the Writer agent
5. Published files in the specified formats
