# ResearchGPT
ResearchGPT is an open-source autonomous agent designed for comprehensive online research on a variety of tasks. It produces detailed research reports in PDF format, with customization options for focusing on relevant resources, outlines, and lessons. Inspired by AutoGPT, ResearchGPT addresses issues of speed and determinism, offering a more stable performance and increased speed through parallelized agent work, as opposed to synchronous operation.

# Why ResearchGPT?

- To form abjective conclusions for manual research tasks can take time, sometimes weeks to find the right online resources.
- Current LLMs are trained on past and sometimes irrelevant information.
- Solutions that enable web search such as ChatGPT + Web Plugin, only consider limited resources that in some cases result in superficial conclusions or biased answers.
- Using only a selection of resources can create bias in determing the right conclusions and answers. 

# Architecture
The main idea is to run a "planner" and "execution" agent, whereas the planner generates questions to research, and the execution agents seek the most related information. Finally, the planner aggregates all related information and creates a final research report.

More specifcally:
* Generate a set of research questions that together form an objective opinion on any task. 
* For each research question, trigger a research agent that scrapes online resources for information relevant to the given task.
* For each relevant inforamtion, summarize it and keep track of its sources.
* Finally, aggreate all summarized information and generate a final research report.
